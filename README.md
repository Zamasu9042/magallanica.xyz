# magallanica.xyz
A (not live) repository of my website (https://magallanica.xyz). 
As I use a FTP system from local to edit the website directly, I will periodically edit this every so often.

### Website FAQ

###### Um I don't see a github.io or a github pages link... is this bugged?!
Nope its not bugged this is a separate non-live repository for the website containing only the design and basic functionalities.

###### Site isn't fully functional... some directories are missing!
Unfortunately as I want to protect some of my files you cannot have access to certain directories locally as they may contain sensitive information. 
However, you can download these files (if publicly available on the live site) via a direct download to your device.
